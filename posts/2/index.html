<p>This is the continuation of the <a href="http://ivoroshilin.com/2014/10/30/docker-a-birds-eye-view/">previous article</a>. This series shows how simple it is to create a lightweight HTTP-server based on <a href="http://spray.io">Spray</a> framework, put it into a <a href="https://docs.docker.com">Docker</a>-image and run multiple instances on any single machine requiring no dependencies.</p>

<h3>Implementing a lightweight RESTful HTTP Service</h3>

<p>The whole project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/vibneiro/DockerSprayHttpServer">GitHub</a>. For impatient, git pull it and jump right to the next section. We&rsquo;re going to use Scala and Akka framework along with <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org">SBT</a> build tool. From Spray framework we will use a <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.1-SNAPSHOT/spray-routing/">spray-routing</a> module which has a simple routing DSL for elegantly defining RESTful web services and it works on top of a <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.1-SNAPSHOT/spray-can/#spray-can">spray-can HTTP Server</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>


<p>The REST API is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GET/welcome &ndash;> responds with a &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; and Post-hyperlink.</p></li>
<li><p>POST/terminate &ndash;> will stop the server.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>DSL describing this API is inside of a method <strong>startServer.  </strong>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to show the full power of Spray because this article is solely about Docker.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s run it and check:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl http://localhost:8080/welcome</code></pre></div>


<h3>Dockerizing the server</h3>

<p>Because the Docker Engine uses Linux-specific kernel features, I&rsquo;m going to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/">lightweight virtual machine</a> to run it on OS X. If you too, just download it, install and run - easy peasy. Just make sure before dockerizing that you&rsquo;ve set the following 3 env variables for connecting your client to the VM:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">DOCKER_HOST</span><span class="o">=</span>tcp://192.168.59.103:2376
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">DOCKER_CERT_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/Users/ivan/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY</span><span class="o">=</span>1</code></pre></div>


<p>The remaining stuff doesn&rsquo;t differ much.</p>

<p>We use a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/dockerfile/java/">trusted automated java build</a> (OpenJDK Java 7 JRE Dockerfile) as a base of our image.</p>

<p>First, you will need to create a Dockerfile for the image in your project:</p>

<pre><code># Our base image
FROM dockerfile/java

WORKDIR /

USER daemon

# Here the stuff that we're going to place into the image
ADD target/scala-2.11/docker-spray-http-server-assembly-1.0.jar /app/server.jar

# entry jar to be run in a container
ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-jar", "/app/server.jar" ]

# HTTP port
EXPOSE 8080
</code></pre>

<p>Build your project as a single jar file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">DockerSprayHttpServer<span class="nv">$ </span>sbt assembly</code></pre></div>


<p>And now navigate to the project&rsquo;s folder and run:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">DockerSprayHttpServer<span class="nv">$ </span>docker build .</code></pre></div>


<p>This will send the newly created image to the Docker daemon.</p>

<h3>Running multiple instances on a single machine</h3>

<p>Run the following command to see available docker images :</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">DockerSprayHttpServer<span class="nv">$ </span>docker images</code></pre></div>


<p><a href="https://ivoroshilin.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/d181d0bdd0b8d0bcd0bed0ba-d18dd0bad180d0b0d0bdd0b0-2014-12-15-d0b2-23-48-52.png"><img src="https://ivoroshilin.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/d181d0bdd0b8d0bcd0bed0ba-d18dd0bad180d0b0d0bdd0b0-2014-12-15-d0b2-23-48-52.png" alt="Снимок экрана 2014-12-15 в 23.48.52" /></a></p>

<p>a83cda03f529 is not in the repo yet - what we&rsquo;ve just created. We&rsquo;re going to run multiple instances from it.</p>

<p>First run the 1-st instance:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">DockerSprayHttpServer<span class="nv">$ </span>docker run -d -p 10001:8080 a83cda03f529</code></pre></div>


<p>Note, that we have mapped our 8080&ndash;>10001 port.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s verify the container is running:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">DockerSprayHttpServer<span class="nv">$ </span>docker ps</code></pre></div>


<p><a href="https://ivoroshilin.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/d181d0bdd0b8d0bcd0bed0ba-d18dd0bad180d0b0d0bdd0b0-2014-12-16-d0b2-0-58-12.png"><img src="https://ivoroshilin.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/d181d0bdd0b8d0bcd0bed0ba-d18dd0bad180d0b0d0bdd0b0-2014-12-16-d0b2-0-58-12.png" alt="Снимок экрана 2014-12-16 в 0.58.12" /></a></p>

<p>We exposed port 8080 for the http-server. When run in Docker-container, it maps our port onto another. On top of this I am  on OS X. Do you remember we set at the beginning 3 env vars? One of them is DOCKER_HOST.</p>

<p>You can actually check this IP as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">DockerSprayHttpServer<span class="nv">$ </span>boot2docker ip</code></pre></div>


<p>We need to use this IP address (for OS X, as we are not on Linux).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test it:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">DockerSprayHttpServer<span class="nv">$ </span>curl <span class="k">$(</span>boot2docker ip<span class="k">)</span>:10001/welcome</code></pre></div>


<p>Great!</p>

<p>You can run as many containers as you want! They are completely isolated. For Scala developers, by they way, I&rsquo;ve found a<a href="https://github.com/marcuslonnberg/sbt-docker"> nice contribution</a>, you can dockerize your artifacts right from SBT.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Docker is a new container technology that primarily allows to run multiple applications on the same old server and operating system. It also makes it easy to package and ship applications. Let&rsquo;s analyze why Docker can become a replacement of virtual machines and why it is better (or not). Though, undoubtedly it has easy-to-use deployment stuff.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivoroshilin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/docker.png"><img src="https://ivoroshilin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/docker.png" alt="docker" /></a></p>

<h3>The gist</h3>

<p>VM hypervisors emulate virtual hardware and guzzle system resources heavily - each VM has its separated operating system. Conversely, Docker containers use a single shared operating system. Basically, each container has only its application and other dependencies. It is very lightweight as we don&rsquo;t set up a separate operating system for each container. You can run much more applications (containers) in a single physical instance of hardware unlike VM with Docker. Docker is extremely rapidly getting popular, because It&rsquo;s light, simple and you can save a great deal of money on hardware and electricity.</p>

<p>There are 2 major parts of operating system (Linux) that ensure the proper work of Docker.</p>

<h3>LXC</h3>

<p>Docker is built on top of LXC and allows to divide up operating system&rsquo;s Kernel. It means that with Docker it is possible to use only Linux and share a single operating system for all containers. I&rsquo;ve heard, by the way, that Windows platform has recently adapted Docker too.</p>

<p>The LXC technology (<a href="http://lxc.sourceforge.net/">LinuX Containers</a>), which Docker is based from, relies on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux">SELinux</a> and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a> to keep everyone in their own sandbox. You can restrict hardware resources: CPU, memory, disk. It can also manage the networking and mounts of filesystem for you as well. In other words you can run multiple isolated Linux containers on one host. Linux Containers serve as a lightweight alternative to VMs as they don’t require the hypervisors. Unlike VMs, LXC don’t require the hypervisor - this is not VM, but an ordinary host.</p>

<p>Assume, you have a container image of 1 GB. If you want to use virtualization, you will need 1 GB multiplied by a number of VMs required. With LXC you just share 1GB. Having 1 thousand containers requires just a little over 1GB of space for the containers OS, assuming they are all running the same OS image. Furthermore, LXCs have have better performance compared to VMs.</p>

<h3>AuFS</h3>

<p>Another technology used in Docker is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs">AuFS</a> -  advanced multi layered unification filesystem. Docker can save images for you and they can be represented as incremental updates to the baseline snapshots. You may have a base snapshot of e.g. Linux, make minor changes to it, save a new snapshot as a diff. AuFS allows incrementally merge all these snapshot updates into a single layered snapshot. That is the idea.</p>

<h3>When to use Docker</h3>

<p>If you need a full isolation of resources, a virtual machine is the way to go. However, if you need to run hundreds of isolated processes on an average host, then Docker is a good fit. There are some use cases when Docker is a win. I can see it as a good tool for development where you run tons of containers on a single machine, doing some interesting stuff in parallel with different deployments from a single Docker image. E.g. you can run a large number of development environments on the same host. For example, Dev, QA, Performance environments on old hardware also. Have a look at <a href="http://www.fig.sh">Fig</a> project which is intended for these purposes and works along with Docker. It has a straightforward tutorial and super easy commands.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Docker is another technique for performing the same tasks as in Virtual Machines but with the restriction of a shared OS Linux. It  is not quite mature however. There might be potential exploits to crash operating system bringing down all of the processes at once. This is the main drawback of Containers, whereas VMs ensure complete isolation. Besides that many companies use one in Production you might want to wait, but you can definitely start playing around with it on your dev continuous integration process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey there! This post is devoted to business rule engines and solely written based on my research and experience with Open-Source <a href="http://www.drools.org">Drools</a> engine that has been used in Production for more than 1 year in mission-critical systems. Undoubtedly, this engine is great for many features. But, I want to explain you what you should think of before using it or when not to use it all. Because it is very important step, once you adapted it in your project, it will be quite costly to remove one later.  I am going to be quick on the theory here, pointing you at issues and important things. If you don&rsquo;t understand something, feel free to ask me but first please refer to the official documentation. I&rsquo;ll try to underline the major issue I&rsquo;ve come across, surely there are many more.</p>

<p>A rule engine is not a magical box that does something new . It is intended to be a tool that provides a higher level of abstraction so you can focus less on reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>On one of our projects we had a critical system with thousands of small &ldquo;if then else if&hellip;&rdquo; requirements from business that were initially developed as a sequence of checks on java. Gradually, we realized how this clutter turned into a very difficult mess to maintain. Hence we made a decision to apply some open source rule engine framework. After some high-level research Drools framework became our choice, primarily because it is free and open source. No one had experience on the team with commercial rule engines, however.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>

<p><img src="https://ivoroshilin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/rule-engine-inkscape.png" alt="rule-engine-inkscape" /></p>

<h3><strong>The order of rules execution</strong></h3>

<p>Rule-engines are a good fit if you don&rsquo;t know the order in which rules are executed, e.g. the order doesn&#8217;t matter. Frequently, in order to understand this, you have to decompose your logic in such a way that you have separated simple flat rules not depending on each other.  In a nutshell, Rule engine is like a black box that have inputs and outputs. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Besides, when rules change objects data, that are used in other rules, it greatly increases complexity. Hence you always should be vigilant on the order of execution of different rules.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the order is determinate, frequently it would be better-off using BPM-engines or something else.</p>

<h3><strong>Clear domain model with stable public API</strong></h3>

<p>Rule-engines are not a fit if your system doesn&rsquo;t have a <strong>clear domain model.</strong> Most non-mature systems don&rsquo;t have one. It&rsquo;s evolution, sometimes requiring to understand with time. Even clear requirements not always so clear in practice. Why am I saying this? Well,  because a good rule of thumb it that:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Rules should be working with only the Domain Model of your system with clear public API around it. If they don&#8217;t, your rules ultimately will turn into unmanageable mess. Period!&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>It seems to be natural, but many developers don&rsquo;t realize it. Imagine, what happens if you rules start using internal code or other API that is not a part of domain logic.  With such a disgusting approach, the rules will be aware of more then they need to, like internal implementations/behaviors  and other dependencies =<strong> tightly coupled code</strong>. It&rsquo;s just like in OOP or SOA principles but in terms of rules. Tightly coupled code/rules is very difficult to change. Needless to say, if this code is not encapsulated. Eventually, you will have to modify your code triggering broken rules very often, when business requirements change.</p>

<h3>Indepotence or exactly once</h3>

<p>All rules must run multiple times without errors yielding the same result. It&rsquo;s like writing a bash-script and also considered a good rule of thumb. Otherwise you may encounter lots of misbehaving weird things.</p>

<h3><strong>Forget Debugging tools, %100 coverage with tests is needed</strong></h3>

<p>Rule-engines are difficult to refactor, you would have to analyze them and/or keep the whole graph in mind if there are dependencies. In terms of Drools it is impossible to trace rules line-by-line. Drools-rules are declarative and don&rsquo;t have a mechanism to debug them. Therefore, you should ideally cover 100% of your rules with JUnit-tests. I can give you a hint to use Spock-framework on top of Groovy as a Behavioural-Driven Development stuff, where each rule is simply covered with a test. Tests usually come directly from business specs. Each rule should contain only 1 simple thing as minimal as possible.</p>

<h3>Cost of change</h3>

<p>No one has any idea if there are conflicting rules when a new one is added or existing one is changed.  A complete regression test must be done when rules are changed. The Memory is sometimes a big issue too. And you can do very little to reduce the consumption - you use 3-rd party framework.</p>

<h3><strong>Some rules need to be triggered twice or more</strong></h3>

<p>Somebody of you can claim that Drools has a feature of rule-invalidation of Facts, but this again turns into unobvious, tangled mess getting in the way to quickly understand why rules yielded such a result. It&rsquo;s up to you, but you never know whether you will have to flush/invalidate rules in the long run.</p>

<h3>Rete Algorithm vs your Domain API and traversals</h3>

<p>The majority of modern rule engines including Drools work upon so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm">Rete Algorithm</a>. Make sure that your codebase, which your rules call, can be built by a Rete algorithm in the working memory. If it&rsquo;s not, tree traversal of your codebase within rules on such a model will be a big performance issue!  Bear in mind, if you have internal traversal logic inside your public domain API (e.g. some of your methods do traversal for you) happening on LHS (Left hand side operation) clause , it is very bad for Drools&#8217; performance as latter has its own <strong>flexible querying model directly</strong> related to Rete-tree. Drools itself should be able to build the tree for you based on your API and efficiently traverse it.</p>

<h3>Performance and external systems</h3>

<p>What if you are required to save a set of operations to a database and each operation must be checked via rule engine. And the next operation depends on the result of the previous one. This imposes performance problems. All operation could be validated and afterwards saved in 1 go. Think it through in advance. I know there are Rule Groups in Drools, but my point - it&rsquo;s very complicated.</p>

<h3>Rules Centralization</h3>

<p>The same business rules may apply across different services, leading to redundancy and governance challenges. It imposes a burden upon us to keep the content of those rules in synch over time.  Thus, it is usually recommended to move them to a new dedicated rule service. The downside is that such a service becomes an additional architectural dependency for other services. The responsibility to build and maintain centralized rule service can introduce various headaches. When we need to change currently active rules or introduce new ones we need to ensure that these changes to the existing rule architecture do not have negative or unforeseen impacts, the worst of which can be a cascading effect that causes exceptions that compound across multiple rules (and multiple services), which should be thoroughly tested.</p>

<p>And please! Make sure that your services know nothing about rules but only talk to the service via a clear contract.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This write-up only scratched the surface of issues coming from my experience. To be honest with you, I would say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to applying rule engine frameworks in my future projects to a large number of systems. Initially it seems to be pretty easy, but eventually you realize, that third-party rule engines are more of a pain that benefit, especially when it comes to interdependencies and a domain model. Project maintenance becomes very costly due to this.  It&rsquo;s not as simple as coding a bunch of <code>if </code>statements. The rules engine gives you the tools to handle rule relationships, but you still have to be able to imagine all of that in your mind.</p>

<p>The most important thing, it is quite difficult to use a rule engine effectively and correctly. A team should have solid knowledge of how to use it and understanding with implementation of business model should be mature. Rule engines work well if there is a really flat independent logic among rules/facts. Each framework restricts you to use their specific model. It&rsquo;s not worth it!</p>

<p>If you are not aware a website called <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> has hundreds of algorithmic problems. Despite that most of them are related to math it&rsquo;s a good resource to warm up/train your brain in coding. You can use any programming language that you want and track progress.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of interesting Euler&rsquo;s problems in terms of diversity from my point of view with the aim to improve not only math but also programming skils (No/ Problem Titile):</p>

<p>11 - Largest product in a grid
12 - Highly divisible triangular number
15 - Lattice paths
24 - Lexicographic permutations
54 - Poker hands
59 - XOR decryption
62 - Cubic permutations
67 - Maximum path sum II
68 - Magic 5-gon ring
78 - Coin partitions
79 - Passcode derivation
81 - Path sum: two ways
86 - Cuboid route
94 - Almost equilateral triangles
96 - Sudoku
100 - Arranged probability
107 - Minimal network
109 - Darts
114 - Counting block combinations I
115 - Counting block combinations II
116 - Red, green or blue tiles
117 - Red, green, and blue tiles
145 - How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?
148 - Exploring Pascal&rsquo;s triangle
150 - Searching a triangular array for a sub-triangle having minimum-sum
154 - Exploring Pascal&rsquo;s pyramid
165 - Intersections
166 - Criss Cross
181 - Investigating in how many ways objects of two different colours can be grouped
182 - RSA encryption
186 - Connectedness of a network
194 - Coloured Configurations
208 - Robot Walks
209 - Circular Logic
232 - The Race
267 - Billionaire
275 - Balanced Sculptures
280 - Ant and seeds</p>

<p>Note that it is highly recommended to solve all Euler&rsquo;s problems one by one because solving a previous problem has a clue to the next ones.</p>
